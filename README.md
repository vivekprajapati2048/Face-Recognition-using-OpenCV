# Face-Recognition-using-OpenCV
This repository consists of Face Recognition using OpenCV in Python in which the model can recognize the face from image and realtime via webcam.

## Contents:
* **trainingImages** folder contains the images for classifier.  
If you want to classifier to recognize the multiple people the add each persons image in a seperated folder markerd by seperate labels. Then add this labels in *tester.py* script (in *name* variable).  
* **TestImages** folder contains the images that you want to predict

### Running the tests
Run **tester.py** script in command line to train the recognizer on training images and also to predict test images.
